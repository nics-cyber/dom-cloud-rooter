## What the Script Does

1. **Installs `proot`**:
   - Downloads the `proot` binary and makes it executable.
   - Stores it in the `~/proot` directory.

2. **Clones the `freeroot` Repository**:
   - Clones the `freeroot` repository from GitHub into the `~/freeroot` directory.

3. **Merges `freeroot` with `proot`**:
   - Copies the contents of the `freeroot` repository into the `proot` directory to enhance functionality.

4. **Downloads and Installs Ubuntu**:
   - Downloads the Ubuntu base image (Ubuntu 20.04 by default) and extracts it into the `~/ubuntu` directory.

5. **Sets Up the Environment**:
   - Configures the `resolv.conf` file to ensure network connectivity within the chroot environment.

6. **Enters the Ubuntu Environment**:
   - Uses `proot` to enter the Ubuntu environment, providing a root-like shell without requiring actual root access.

## Notes

- **Network Configuration**:
  The script sets up a basic network configuration using Google's public DNS servers (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`). You can modify this in the `resolv.conf` file if needed.

- **Ubuntu Version**:
  The script installs Ubuntu 20.04 by default. To use a different version, modify the `wget` command in the script to download the desired base image.

- **Dependencies**:
  Ensure `wget`, `git`, and `tar` are installed on your system. These are typically available by default on most Linux distributions.

- **No Root Access Required**:
  The script is designed to work without root or sudo access, making it ideal for restricted environments.
